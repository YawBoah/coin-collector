# ü¶ä Fox and Coin Game ü™ô
Welcome to the exciting world of the **Fox and Coin Game**! This is a simple yet thrilling game where you control a fox to collect as many coins as possible within a limited time. The game is built using Python and the Pygame Zero library.

## üéÆ How to Play
The game is straightforward. You control a fox that moves around the screen to collect coins. Each time the fox touches a coin, your score increases by 10 points, and a new coin appears at a random location on the screen. But be quick! You only have 7 seconds to collect as many coins as you can.

## üìù Code Explanation
Here's a brief overview of what each part of the code does:

- `import pgzrun`: This line imports the Pygame Zero run module, which contains the game loop.

- `width=100` and `height=100`: These lines set the width and height of the game window.

- `game_over = False` and `score = 0`: These lines initialize the game state and the player's score.

- `fox = Actor("fox")` and `coin = Actor("coin")`: These lines create the fox and coin actors (game characters).

- `def draw()`: This function is responsible for drawing the game state onto the screen.

- `def place_coin()`: This function will be used to place the coin at a new location each time it is collected by the fox.

- `def time_up()`: This function sets the game state to over after 7 seconds.

- `def update()`: This function updates the game state. It checks for keyboard input to move the fox and checks for collision between the fox and the coin.

- `pgzrun.go()`: This line starts the game loop.
